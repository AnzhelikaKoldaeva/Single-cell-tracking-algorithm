# Single-cell-tracking-algorithm
The algorithm for tracking every single bacteria in a dense growing population

The algorithm is based on the idea of constructing local structures using Delaunay triangulations. Since it is a dense population (with no or very small distances between the individuals), relative positions of each cell with respect to other cells are more informative than their absolute positions. Therefore, the construction of local structures is a more beneficial approach here.
